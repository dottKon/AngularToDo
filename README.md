# Todolistapp

So, when I wanted to kick off with Angular I stumbled upon many tutorials presenting on how to do the basic CRUD operations, most of them were using AngularJS while the thing that interested me at the time was to make the same thing with the modern functions of Angular 5. 

## Description

This project lets you create the a To-Do list of tasks, add the new tasks, delete them and mark as 'done'. When you mark your task as 'done', it is automatically being moved to the bottom of the list. I used Google's Firebase to store the data of the app.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.
